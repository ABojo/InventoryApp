# InventoryCMS
An inventory CMS built with Express for the <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/inventory-application'>Odin Project Curriculum</a>.

This CMS was built to allow non-technical online store owners the ability to easily add, remove, and edit the categories/products in their online store.

Admins of the store can interact with this backend panel to easily update their websites database and then have the changes they make to the products/categories reflected on the front end.
